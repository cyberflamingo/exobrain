# Taking Back Control of Digital Life

Like most kids my age in the nineteens, I've spent a fair share bit of my time
online.

First with one or more username, then, with the advent of Facebook and other
social network, with my real name (or something close enough to be identifiable.

For the last few years, I've been in the process of taking back control of my
digital life. At first I was motivated by a mix of disgust by what I was—as a
digital marketer—able to get out of people's data, and other personal reasons.

While I believe most information out there would not lead to difficult
situation even if revealed, the never ending number of privacy and security
related events of the last few years have convinced me I am right to at least
try to limit what is outside about me.

## What It Means

Taking back control of digital life means:

* Having more of my digital life close to me (self-hosted)
* Minimizing reliance on third party services
* Being smarter about the product I use and
* Being aware of how much personal information I disclose


## Long Term Project

This is a the long term project. When I first thought about everything I did
online since I first started using the Internet, I quickly realize retrieving, 
deleting or at least limiting access to most thing will be a very daunting task.
One which can not be done in weeks, months but only years.

But this is okay. This is because **privacy is a marathon, not a sprint**.

Whatever the reason for wanting to live a more private life, one should start
small and remember that even if you can't be completely private in the near
future, each step should make you more secure, more private and more in charge
of your online identity.
