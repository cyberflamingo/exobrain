# No, We Cannot Learn to Live with this Privacy Paradigm

Or more generally, "No, We Cannot Learn to Live with this new X in cyberspace".

This is an argument I hear way too often:

> Well, we will get used to X like we got use to Y and Z.
> <footer class="">—A Concerned Citizen</footer>

For a long time I thought this way as well ; after all we learned to live with
other technology, right? What makes _you_ think we can't learn to live with
_this new thing_(™)?

But there is a fundamentaly different point of view to be aware of here, and
very important: _this new thing_(™) is driven by technology advancing
exponentially. Computer processing power from 1960 to today has gone up about a
trillion times.

Nothing new that we had, had improve at this rate. No matter how amazing you
think the human brain is, we simply cannot keep up.
