# Fawkes: Digital Image Cloaking

[Fawkes](https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/) is a system that manipulate
images in order to make facial recognition impossible on it.

Theoretically, Fawkes makes tiny pixel-level changes to the images, invisible
to the human eye (again, theoretically) but which will teach distorted version
of the picture to the face recognition model.

What's great is it wont raise error in the model training and thus attracting
attention to the skewed pictures.

Two images of you, one unaltered and one altered by Fawkes will be seen by the
facial recognition system as two different person.
