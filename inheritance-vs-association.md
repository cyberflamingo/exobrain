# Inheritance vs. Association

**Inheritance** can be thought of as an is-a relationship. For example, a
dictionary is a book.

**Association** can be thought of as a has-a relationship. For example, a
library has books, so there is an associative relationship between objects of
class Library and objects of class Book.
