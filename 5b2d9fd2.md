# Introduction to OSINT

## What is OSINT?

OSINT stands for **O**pen **S**ource **Int**elligence. It refers to the
collection, processing and analysis of publicly available data that has been
deteremined to be of intelligence value.

The U.S. Department of Defense defines OSINT as:

> [Information] produced from publicly available information that is
collected, exploited, and disseminated[^1] in a timely manner to an
appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence
requirement.

Sources of OSINT include surface, deep and dark web, social media, news media,
academic sources, and government records.

Contrary to other forms of intelligence, OSINT uses legally accessible
information, without breaching copyright and or privacy laws. _Open_ refers
to **overt**, publicly available sources, as opposed to **covert** sources
which are hidden and confidential.

This distinction makes OSINT accessible to people outside law enforcment.

## Difference Between Information and Data

OSINT interests itself in _information_ in contrast with just data. The
difference is best explained with an illustration.

Let's take some random numbers: 6 - 9 - 13 - 24 - 41

Out of context, they mean absolutely nothing. These numbers are just data:
numbers in that case but it  could have been random values like words and
characters.

Let's add some context: this are actually the winning lottery numbers of
[December 11th, 2020
(France)](https://www.bfmtv.com/loto/resultat-euromillions-le-tirage-du-vendredi-11-decembre-2020_AN-202012110368.html).

Now, this data becomes _information_ and it has much bigger value (it
would have even more value if it was the winning numbers for the _next_
lottery).

The main difference is: **the context**.

When you put data in the right context, it automatically becomes
information.

## Types of OSINT

OSINT can be divided in two big categories: offenseive and defensive.

### Offensive

Gather information before an attack.

### Defensive

Learn about possible attacks (vector) against yourself, your company, your
client etc.

## The OSINT Cycle

See [[osint-cycle]]#.

[^1]: In this context it means "reported", which is one of the hardest part of OSINT.
