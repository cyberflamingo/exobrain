# The Zettelkasten Principles

Things to remember when writing notes with the Zettelkasten method
(shamelessly taken from [here](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125#0cfa)):

1. **Atomicity**: each note should contain one idea and one idea only.
2. **Autonomy**: each note should be self-contained and comprehensivle on its own.
3. **Always link**: "each note is just an element that derives its quality from the network of links in the system. A note that is not connected to the network will be lostm will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten."
4. **Explain why you're linking notes**
5. **Use your own words**
6. **Keep references**
7. **Add your own thughts**
8. **Don't worry about structure**: "there are no privileged positions."
9. **Add connection notes**
10. **Add outline notes**
11. **Never Delete**
12. **Add notes without fear**
