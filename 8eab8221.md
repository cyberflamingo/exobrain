# NUT on OpenWrt

Here are the steps I took to set up NUT at home between a NAS (server) and an Openwrt router (client).

First, on the **NUT server**, make sure it is set with `MODE=netserver`.

Next, add the folowing directive for the client:

In `/etc/nut/upsd.conf` you should add

```
LISTEN 192.168.1.2 #IP of the client
```

Next, on the **client**:

Make sure you have installed `nut-client` which is the useful package for this use case.

Inside `/etc/nut/nut/nut.conf`, make sure there is `MODE=netclient`.

In `$HOMEBREW/nut/config/nut-monitor` (or something similar) you should have the following rules:

```
config slave
   option upsname ups
   option hostname 192.168.1.1
   option username upsmon
   option password secret
```

Replace `upsname`, `hostname`, `username` and `password` with the settings on the NUT server (thoses should be in `/etc/nut/upsd.user`).

Type `upsmon -D` in the terminal of the client and check for errors (may need to stop it first as it can't start more than one time).

This should generate the `/etc/nut/upsmon.conf` file.

Some docs says to use `upsdrvctl -t shutdown`. It didn't work on my system but good to know to try to simulate a shutdown (without actually powering off).

If everything work so far, try the next command (make sure to save all works as this will power off the client):

`upsmon -c fsd`

NUT should be set up now.
