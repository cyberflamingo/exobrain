# Linux Full Disk Encryption

[Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) (and probably some others) does it transparently, which is nice.

I have not figured out how to do it manually yet but [Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/encryption/use-luks-for-full-disk-encryption/) seems to have a good guide.
