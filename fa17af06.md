# Convert Decimal Degrees into Degrees, Minutes, Seconds

A map's geographic coordinates can be given in Decimal Degrees (DD, like
121.135째) or in Degrees, Minutes and Seconds (DMS, like 121째8'6"), which is
more common.


## Conversion

Basic concept:

1. The whole units gives the degrees
2. Multiply the decimal portion by 60; the whole units gives the minutes
3. Again, multiply the decimal portion multiplied by 60; the whole units gives
the seconds
4. Puts the number together

Formula:

Knowing that `1째 = 60' = 3600"`, let's say `dd = 121.135`

1. d = integer(dd) = 121째
2. m = integer((dd - d) * 60) = 8'
3. s = (dd - d - m / 60) * 3600 = 6"
