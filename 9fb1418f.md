# Leaning toothpick syndrome

In computer programming "Leaning toothpick syndrome" is an expression used when quoted expression
becomes unreadable because it contains a large number of escape characters,
usually backslashes `\`.

Examples:

`\\\\\\\\`

`\/\/`

The official Perl documentation introduced the term to wide usage, apparently.


## Japanese Environment

In Japanese environment, the Yen symbol `¥` is often (alwasy?) used in lieu of backslash `\`. That means LTS is shown differently:

`¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥`

`¥/¥/`

Second case is more readable.
