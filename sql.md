SQL
===

SQL, meaning **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, is a programming
language used to communicate with a relational database.

It uses simple English sentences that allow to `SELECT` (find), `INSERT`
(add), `UPDATE` (change) or `DELETE` (remove) data.

SQL is a *declarative* language: in a SQL statement you describe
**what** needs to be done, but not **how** to do it; the later, as well
as the execution, is handled by the
[[relational-database-management-system]]#.

SQL Sub-Languages
-----------------

One can think of SQL as three separate sub-languages which their
specificities:

-   **DDL: Data Definition Language**: define the structure of a
    database and the tables and columns within it
-   **DML: Data Manipulation Language**: retrieve or modify data stored
    in a database (ex: `SELECT` queries)
-   **DCL: Data Control Language**: determine what various users are
    allowed to do when interacting with a database
