# Ruby's Pass by Reference of the Value

As senn in <946b1445>, there are mainly two ways of dealing with objects passed
into methods: **Pass by Reference** and **Pass by Value**.

However, Ruby does things slightly differently:

When passing a object to a method, the object is scoped to this method
definition level. Reassigment of the object won't affect the original object.
_However_, when performing an action that **mutates the caller**, the original
object is altered as well.
