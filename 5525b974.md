# Ruby Syntactical Sugar Pitfalls

Ruby hides away under the hood a lot of writting which are common in other
languages. One benefit is easier and faster writting, and (generally) easier
parsing of the code.

There are some pitfalls to this syntactical sugar.


## Local Variable and Method with the Same Name

Say we have a code with a variable and a method of the same name:

```ruby
stringify = 'a string'

def stringify
  'a method'
end

p stringify # => "a string"
```

It seems that when a method and a variable have the same name, Ruby prioritize
the variable over the method invocation. This is actually not the case.

What happen is we asked Ruby to print the variable `stringify`. If we wanted to
invoke the method, we would need to use:

```ruby
p stringify() # => "a method"
```

Like a lot of other programming language, Ruby uses the syntax `method_name` +
`()` to invoke a method. **This syntax can be shortcut to `method_name`
if and only if there is no method with the same name.**

Most of the time though, our code will use the shortcut writting. It is best to
avoid this problem altogether and use different names for our methods and our
variables.


## Using Too Much Syntax Shortcut

Taking the same example as above, actually what we are really trying to do is:

```ruby
p(stringify()) # => "a method"
```

While `p stringify` is easier to read (closer to English), it does not tell you
if `stringify` is a method or a variable.

Counsciously writting parenthesis aroud method, like `p(stringify)`, while
slightly more difficult to parse, is more straightforward: we are using the
method `p()` on a variable `stringify`.
