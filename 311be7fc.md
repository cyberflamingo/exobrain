# Audit File Access on Linux

Install the `auditd` packages on Debian/Ubuntu etc.

```sh
apt install auditd audispd-plugins
```

{.ui .info .message}
I didn't add `sudo` by security but it is most probably required.

Then start the service if necessary:

```sh
systemctl start auditd
```

You can now create audit rules for files you want to inspect based on a set of
rules.

```sh
auditctl -w /etc/hosts -p war -k hosts-file
```

Where `w` is the path to the file to _w_atch, `p` is _p_ermissions filter
(_w_rite, _a_ppend, _r_ead) and `k` is a _k_ey to uniquely identify the audit
records produced by the watch.

Check that your rule is listed:

```sh
$ auditctl -l
-w /etc/hosts -p rwa -k hosts-file
```

Now we just have to wait for `auditctl` to log some events!

As we used a filter key for our rule (`hosts-file`) it is easy to search for
event with the following command:


```sh
ausearch -ts today -k hosts-file
```
