# false vs nil And The Idea of "truthiness"


## false vs nil

`false` is a Boolean value which evaluate to false in a condition.

`nil` represents the nothing. It shall not be confused with emptyness. `""` is
an empty string, but it is not nothing, therefore different from `nil`. `nil`
evaluates to false in a Boolean context.

`flase` and `nil` are two different objects and their values are also
different; respectively false and nil. However, _in Ruby_, the value they
evaluate to in a Boolean context is false for both (see Truthiness below for
more information).


The reason there are `nil` and `false` and not just `false` is they serve
different purpose:

* `false` and `true` are used in Boolean expressions
* `nil` is the value returned when something went awry or when there's nothing
  to return (no even emptyness)


## Truthiness

In Ruby, every value except `false` and `nil` evaluates to true in a Boolean
context. Another way to say it is that every value except the two above are
"truthy". On the other hand, this also means that `false` and `nil` are
"falsey".

A common mistake made when first learning about truthiness is to think "well,
this is just like `true` and `false`!"

As the result of the comparison being done is often the same whether you use a
Boolean or truthiness, the distinction between the two may seems overzealous at
first, but there are good reasons to distinguish them (<f097fac0>).

When describing a piece of code including truthy or falsey, make sure to say
so, and not use the word "true" or "false" or even say they are equal to true
or false.
