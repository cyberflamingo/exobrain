# false vs nil And The Idea of "truthiness"


## false vs nil

_In construction_


## Truthiness

In Ruby, every value except `false` and `nil` evaluates to true in a Boolean
context. Another way to say it is that every value except the two above are
"truthy". On the other hand, this also means that `false` and `nil` are
"falsey".

A common mistake made when first learning about truthiness is to think "well,
this is just like `true` and `false`!"

As the result of the comparison being done is often the same whether you use a
Boolean or truthiness, the distinction between the two may seems overzealous at
first, but there are good reasons to distinguish them (<f097fac0>).

When describing a piece of code including truthy or falsey, make sure to say
so, and not use the word "true" or "false" or even say they are equal to true
or false.
