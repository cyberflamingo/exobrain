# 外付け脳 (exobrain)

Welcome to my exobrain, where I upload and share notes for everyone to see.

This exobrain uses [[zettelkasten-principles]] which lets me easily write down things I
want to remember and make association between notes and thoughts.

I also have [a blog](https://www.cyberflamingo.net/) where I write more
lengthy post about security and privacy, in Japanese (see also
[[what-language-should-i-write-in]]).
