# Radio Frequency Explained

## What is Radio Frequency?

First we need to define what is **E**lectro **M**agnetic **R**adiation (EMR):
radiation that has both electrical and magnetic properties.

Anytime an electron move, specially in a copper cable,that sends a current in
the copper cable. If the electron move inside the copper cable between two
batteries, the EMR direction will be at 90 degrees of that.

**Note:** in 3 dimension, if we see the copper cable in front of us (poking us
in the eye), EMR would go in all direction at 90 degrees.

EMR radiation has both *electrical* and *magnetic* properties, and requires *no
medium in order to propagate* (even through the vacuum of space, which is why
radio telescope was often used to detect non-natural, extraterrestrial EMR).

EMR has a detectable waveform: it oscillates. The cycling of this waveform is
measured in Hertz.

In conclusion: **radio frequency is the measurement of the oscillation of
EMR**.

### ISM Bands

EMR frequency bands have been given labels. Those assigned by U.S. Federal
Communications Commission are called **ISM Bands**: *unlicensed* **I**ndustrial,
**S**cientific and **M**edical use.

On a scale from 0 Hz to 3000 EHz (ExaHertz), we can find:

-   Extremely Low (ELF) (Audio)
-   Very Low (Audio)
-   Low
-   Medium (AM Broadcast)
-   High (Shortwave Radio)
-   Very High (Broadcast TV)
-   Ultra High, unlicensed ISM bands are between:
    -   902 - 928 MHz
    -   2.4 - 2.5 GHz
-   Super High, Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) ISM bands
    are:
    -   5.15 - 5.35 GHz
    -   5.47 - 5.875 GHz
-   Infrared
-   Visible Light
-   Ultra-Violet
-   X-Rays
-   Gamma Rays

As a rule of thumbs, the faster the frequency (faster the oscillation), the more
data you can encode. This is why newer Wi-Fi standards are being added on the
*Super High* U-NII/ISM frequency range.

There is a downside though: radio frequency as a tendency to attenuate (encoded
data become unrecognizable; like someone speaking closer to you is more audible
than someone speaking far away from you). For Wi-Fi, it means that a device need
to be closer to the emitter in order to receive information without troubles.

Another downside is as anyone can use ISM bands, they tend to be crowded. This
is the case for 2.4 GHz: microwaves would often interfere with Wi-Fi because they
would induce noise in this same frequency.

## Modulation

Radio Frequency (i.e.Â EMR) has different properties that can be artificially
changed over time to encode data. This process is called **modulation**.

The following properties can be modulated:

-   **Frequency Modulation (FM):** the greater the frequency, the more data can
    be encoded into a Wi-Fi signal
-   **Wavelength:** the distance between two "positives" or two "negatives",
    inversely proportional to frequency
-   **Amplitude Modulation:** the overall strength (or power) of a signal. Note:
    RF amplitude weakens greatly over distance and as it passes through objects
    (this is called *attenuation*)
-   **Phase:** a comparison of the waveform between two RF signals. Two
    identical waveform at comparison time are considered 100% in phase. This
    phase can be intentionally modified to encode data

For newer Wi-Fi versions, all of the modulation above are used in some form to
encode even more data.
