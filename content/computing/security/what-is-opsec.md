What is OPSEC?
==============

According to Wikipedia,

> Operations security (OPSEC) is a process that identifies critical
> information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy
> intelligence. - Wikipedia

A good reason to practice good OPSEC in daily life is to protect
ourselves from hackers, criminals and perhaps a little bit too nosy
government.
