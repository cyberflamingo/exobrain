Threat Modeling
===============

Threat modeling is a process to find threats (vulnerabilities) early on
in order to rank and mitigate them. It is a proactive approach to
security and gives team members a better understanding and knowledge of
the application. The process should fit *into* the organization, and not
the other way around. In other words, the *who* and *when* depends on
the organization.

4 W's of threat modeling:

-   What is Threat Modeling
-   Why you should Threat Model
-   Who should Threat Model
-   When to Treat Model

What is Threat Modeling?
------------------------

Threat modeling needs two important components:

-   **Systematic Approach**: using a model to have a repeatable
    **process**. Threat modeling *is* a process to tackle security in a
    repeatable and consistent fashion during the development life cycle.
    See [[threat-modeling-approach]]#
-   **Looking at Attacks**: actively looking at what and how something
    can be abused. You are looking for *abuse cases* in order to find
    vulnerabilities.

One can see threat modeling as **probable threat scenarios** to which
one produce a **list of potential threats** for a specific application.

Threat modeling is a **holistic approach** to reduce risk and to secure
an application: you are looking at the environment as a *whole* and not
just an isolated software.

See also [[threat-modeling-vocabulary]]# for an overview of often used
vocabulary.

Why Threat Modeling?
--------------------

The goal of threat modeling is **risk reduction**. However there are
myriad of other ways to achieve this goal, so why use threat modeling?

Reasons to use threat modeling include:

-   Pro-active approach: you want to to be pro-active instead of
    reactive afterwards, when threats are discovered during later
    stages. Security up-front.
-   Efficient: the sooner a vulnerability is detected, the cheaper it is
    to fix it. It has a good ROI (business value).
-   Prioritize bugs: to know where to focus energy first.
-   Better understanding: of the whole application. It may help everyone
    have a better insight into potential security issues for the
    application.

Threat modeling is **collaborative, repeatable process**. Not a one-time
exercise.

The output of threat modeling is diagrams, security requirements,
non-requirements, list of threats/vulnerabilities.

Who should Threat Model?
------------------------

We need people who are involved with the application we want to secure.
That means:

-   Application Architect
-   Developer
-   Tester
-   Security Professional

When to Treat Model?
--------------------

As said above, the earlier, the cheaper. Therefore the correct answer is
*as early as possible*. For an application, it is probably during the
**requirements** or **design** phase.

In an agile environment, the threat modeling should ideally be done
during each sprint.

Examples of Threat Models that Go Wrong
---------------------------------------

In practice a big one is the human factor: assuming that the user will
use a strong password and not click on random link are not good
assumptions.

Another good think to remember is that threat model changes over time
and keep up with the technological advancement (like crypotographic key
size).
