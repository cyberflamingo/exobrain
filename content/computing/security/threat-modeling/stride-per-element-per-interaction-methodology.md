# STRIDE-per-Something Methodology

To get started with STRIDE, one can think about all the *element* or all
the *interaction* between components.

STRIDE-per-element is good for beginners, but STRIDE-per-interaction
makes it easier to understand threats.

## STRIDE-per-Element

Different threats affect each type of element:

-   External Entity
-   Process
-   Data Store
-   Dataflow

## STRIDE-per-Interaction

Focus shift from individual elements to the interactions between
elements, then concentrate on where those components "meet".
