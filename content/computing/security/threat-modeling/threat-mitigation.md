# Threat Mitigation

Mitigation is a specific task or step to reduce the likelihood or impact
of a threat.

Three main ways are:

-   **Accept Risk**: low rating or too expensive (more than dealing with
    the threat itself)
-   **Policies/Contracts**: written rules with consequences (for example
    an API with an SLA)
-   **Security Controls (the preferred way to mitigate risks as they
    reduce the likelihood of being exploited)**: code written to reduce
    risk of exploitation ; safety net for developers. Good security
    controls can be used across different applications to make security
    functionality easier to implement. They must be:
    -   Vetted: approved by security team
    -   Requirement: required use across organization; reusable
