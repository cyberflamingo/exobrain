# Trust Boundary and Entry Point

**Trust Boundary:** a place where two entities with different permissions interact with one another.
Threats often come from trust boundaries.

Example: a user from the internet interacts with a web server on corporate network --\> trust boundary between user (not trusted) and web server (trusted).

**Entry Point:** a "door" into your system; user began the interaction and data is entered.
Entry points are always trust boundaries but reverse is not true.
