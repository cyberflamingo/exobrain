# Authorization

Authorization ensures that we give the **correct** privilege levels provided to
subject.

This is done through **access controls**: they permit authorized entities
(persons, processes etc) to perform authorized functions.

Access rights (the permissions), can have different level of granularity such
as:

-   Create
-   Read
-   Update
-   Delete
-   Full control (administrator)

Another layer of access control is **entitlements**: more granular of access
controls, often based on group membership. It enforces access rules.

Access controls are **at the heart of information security**: all of security
comes down to *who* is on our system and *what* can they do on it. And of
course, have a record of all the activities taking place.
