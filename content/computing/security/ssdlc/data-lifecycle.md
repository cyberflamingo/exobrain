# Data Lifecycle

Data must be protected at all stage of its lifecycle, from its **generation**
until its **disposal**.

This includes:

-   Generation: data creation (from another system or customer)
-   Processing
-   Storage
-   Retention: keep the data for a certain length of time
-   Disposition: orderly, planned process of handling data that may still have
    use
-   Disposal: destruction, removal, or transfer to another organization (archive
    etc)

Protection requirements for the data **may change** over its lifecycle: not
everything needs to be protected at all time.

## Data Collection Legal Issues

Country dependent. There may be legal requirements such as:

-   User consent
    -   Collection
    -   Marketing
-   Allowed uses of data (only collecting data that we need)
    -   Sharing
    -   Third-parties (terms)
-   Data accuracy: responsibility to keep data accurate and up to date as much
    as possible
-   Data retention: how long we keep the data, and why, and how to keep it safe
    -   Right to be forgotten
