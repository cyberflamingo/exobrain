# Data Lifecycle

Data must be protected at all stage of its lifecycle, from its **generation**
until its **disposal**.

This includes:

-   Generation: data creation (from another system or customer)
-   Processing
-   Storage
-   Retention: keep the data for a certain length of time
-   Disposition: orderly, planned process of handling data that may still have
    use
-   Disposal: destruction, removal, or transfer to another organization (archive
    etc)

Protection requirements for the data **may change** over its lifecycle: not
everything needs to be protected at all time.

## Data Collection Legal Issues

Country dependent. There may be legal requirements such as:

-   User consent
    -   Collection
    -   Marketing
-   Allowed uses of data (only collecting data that we need)
    -   Sharing
    -   Third-parties (terms)
-   Data accuracy: responsibility to keep data accurate and up to date as much
    as possible
-   Data retention: how long we keep the data, and why, and how to keep it safe
    -   Right to be forgotten

## Data Misuse and Abuse Risks

What are the ways that data could be misused?

-   Improper use by an employee
-   Hacker stealing it

A list of threats and risks must be created.

Other issues:

-   Data aggregation: data that were not sensible or personal in isolation
    becomes, in aggregation, sensible
-   Data inference: learning from watching some piece of data (marketing learns
    about people’s behaviors through when/how/what people buy, for example)
-   Unauthorized access
    -   Ransomware
-   Improper changes: data can’t be trusted anymore because we are being
    provided wrong information (could be a liability in a financial report, for
    example)

## Data Anonymization/De-Anonymization

-   (Pseudo-)Randomization: substitutes value for another so that it’s not
    easily identifiable (obfuscation)
-   Tokenization: identification numbers associated with a user that few people
    know the association of
-   Masking: data masked during input (password) or output (credit card numbers
    partially masked)
-   Encryption: for safe storage and transmission of data
