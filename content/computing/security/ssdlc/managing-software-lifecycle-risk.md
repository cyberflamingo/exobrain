# Managing Software Lifecycle Risk

**Risk management** is not about **risk elimination**: risk is something that is
a part of everyday life and must be managed, but there is still a part of
uncertainty.

**Risk Assessment:** Systematic method of identifying the assets of a data
processing system, the threats to those assets, and the vulnerability of the
system to those threats.

**Risk Management**: Systematic application of management policies, procedures
and practices to the activities of communicating, consulting, establishing the
context and identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring and
reviewing risk.

## Risk Factors

-   Asset value: what are we protecting? Is it critical? Is it sensitive?
-   Threats: internal and external threats, including on purpose and accidental.
    Threats is anything that could go wrong, including the fact that we could
    loose key employees, or that the business process could change.
-   Vulnerabilities: weaknesses or gaps, missing controls or lack of testing
    that allowed that **threat to go undetected and create a real problem**.

## Causes of Lifecycle Risk

-   Business Risk:
    -   Changes to business requirements
    -   Need to adapt quickly
    -   Staffing challenges
    -   New regulations
-   Technical Risk:
    -   Technology becomes outdated or unsupported
    -   Hard to maintain
    -   Unable to support new functionality
    -   Technology may fail causing business interruptions

## Risk Response

Hopefully we are able to detect, evaluate and mitigate the risk. But sometimes
we will found unmitigated risks.

Once we found a risk, we can decide one of the following:

-   Avoid risk: turn off the risky functionality
-   Accept risk: accept to bear the consequences if the risk is exploited
-   Mitigate/reduce risk: use new or additional controls
-   Transfer risk: outsource it, or pass it to an insurance

## Risk Monitoring

We need to continuously monitor risks: what was once secure may be inadequate
now.

Monitoring includes network, transactions, access controls and configuration.

## Residual Risk and the Risk Register

It is impossible to be have 0 risk. There will always have what is called
**residual risk**. There are also unresolved risk that we know we want to
resolve at some point. Those are saved in the **risk register** so they can be
tracked.

The risk register tracks all our known-risk and can therefor give us a **risk
profile**. This profile helps us determine if this is an acceptable level of
risk to management in todayâ€™s world or not.
