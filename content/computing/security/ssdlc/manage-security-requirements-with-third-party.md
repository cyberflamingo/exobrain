# Manage Security Requirements with Third Party

**The laws of many countries require the data owner to be responsible for the
continued protection of data even when the data is processed or stored by a
third party.**

**This requires clear communication of the roles and responsibilities of each
party involved in a third party agreement.**

All relation with third party should be guided by a third party agreements:

-   Contracts
-   SOW (Statements Of Work)
-   Ownership of source code
    -   Escrow
-   Support (software, security)
-   Anything else to ensure what is expected of all parties

Everything from storage, processing, and disaster recovery should be added to
the contracts.

## Legal Considerations

We need to be aware of jurisdiction, where the data reside and if backups are
made on site or in a different country.

In case of disagreement or dispute, we want to stipulate in which country is the
law applicable.

Contracts are also important for the protection of intellectual property; same
with patents.
