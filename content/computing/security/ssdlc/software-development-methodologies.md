# Software Development Methodologies

We want to weave security into the entire development lifecycle.

That means we need a goal: what is security? What is the objectices of secure
software? What are the standards we expect?

The first step is to create a **security strategy roadmap**: we need to pay
attention to security during each phase of the project and continually re-assess
the risk as we go through the development lifecycle, as which each phase, the
risks get clearer and clearer.

We also want to have the component tested against security.

## NIST SSDF

The [NIST Secure Software Development
Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf) starts with *preparing the
organization*. This means having policies, training and standards that will help
the development projects.

**Protect the software:** from unauthorized access or modification

**Produce well-secured software:** minimize vulnerabilities

**Respond to vulnerabilities:** appropriately (respond in an appropriate manner)

Then, we want to **mandate adherence to standards and policy**. All software
must be secure, as even the smallest could be used as an entry point to internal
networks.

A security culture is required, as security is everyone's job. We also want
requirement to pass security audits before product acceptance and release to
production.
