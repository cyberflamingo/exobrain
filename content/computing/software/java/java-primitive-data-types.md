# Java Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are data types built into the Java language.

They are the foundations of all other types and are classified into four
categories:

- Integer (`byte`, `short`, `int` & `long`)
- Floating point (`flaot` & `double`)
- Character (`char`)
- Boolean (`boolean`)

When we work with primitive types in Java, each variable's values are
**unrelated** to any other variable's values. This is important because
other, non-primitive data types's storage are managed differently.
