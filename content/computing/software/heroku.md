# What is Heroku

Heroku is a cloud-based platform-as-a-service (PaaS). As a platform, it manages
container system for building, running and managing apps. It hide away the
burdon of server and infrastructure management and let developper concentrate
on writting/deploying apps.

In other word, it's kind of a "DevOps as a service"; for a developper, that
means being able to focus on writting code and not worry about build and
deployment.
