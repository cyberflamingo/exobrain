Relational DataBase Management System
=====================================

A Relational DataBase Management System or **RDBMS** is a software
application or system for managing relational databases. A RDBMS lets a
user (or application) to interact with a database by issuing *commands*
using a conventional or standardized syntax.

Examples of RDBMS includes [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html),
[Microsoft SQL
Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads),
[[postgresql]]# and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

Every RDBMS varies in complexity and robustest, however they all have
the same underlying language in common: Structured Query Language (SQL).

Non-relational data storage and retrieval models exist, such as
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), which uses a document-oriented data
storage model.
