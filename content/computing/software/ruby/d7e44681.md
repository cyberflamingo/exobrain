# Search and Replace in Ruby

I tend to forgot about the existence of `gsub` when I try to perform a search
and replace action in Ruby.

This note is in order to remember about `gsub` existence. That's it.

`sub` only replaces the _first_ occurrence of the given pattern, while `gsub`
replaces _every_ occurrence.
