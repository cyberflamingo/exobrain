# What language should I write in?

> Why are you flexing three languages?

I thought about which language to write in for a long time.

Living in Japan, writing in Japanese for a Japanese audience seems like a no brainer if I want
to **build closer relationships in this region**.

It is also a good opportunity to develop writen language skills and some new
vocabulary. However, writing in a foreign language, specially one which uses
another alphabet is _very_ time consumming, as evidenced by the low number of
entries on [my blog](https://www.cyberflamingo.net/).

I do have dozens and dozens of drafts, however, but nothing I am confident
enough to publish yet.

Writing in English, will still not my native language, is relativly easier
(although I am sure there are a lot of mistakes in my writing).

On this [[d6cf318e|Zettelkasten]] inspired wiki, notes are in whatever language I was using
at the moment, or more precisely, whatever language was the source of my
findings at the time of taking notes.

It's not flexing. Moreover, nowadays tools like
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) are more than capable enough to give
you the general ideas if you need to read something in a foreign language.

Good read on the subject:
