# Charge More

Patrick McKenzie (patio11) has a lot of great advices and knows how to translate them.
There are a lot of advices to take from his blog, but the passage that struck with me the most is the following one:

> Let's talk about that heart surgeon again.
> Do you think he paid \$5.32 for that doohickey he just planted in you? No possible way.
> He probably paid \$500 or \$1000 for it.
> And, if it ever occurred to him to argue with the sales rep from HeartTech ("Technology with a Heart"), the conversation probably went something like this: "Thats an interesting perspective.
> I suppose you could try making it yourself for \$5.32... or, alternately, you could make \$49,500 tomorrow installing one and be on the golf course by 3:00." And then the good doctor's eyes lit up and the deal got closed.
> Thats essentially what your conversation with the customer should be: regardless of what it took to make my product, my price is a "fair" one because you'll get oh so much more out of it.
> And, seen in that light, most of your customers will agree.
