# Shipped My First SaaS Side Project While Working Full Time

This is a digest of the story of Tigran Hakobyan who shipped his first SaaS as a side project, while working full time at Buffer.
There are other stories like this one but I like this one because it's straightforward and realistic.

Mr Hakobyan started to think about multi-stream income to be less dependent of his main income (his job at the time).

## Ideas

Mr Hakobyan already had a lot of ideas he kept in his notes.
For his future business, he wanted an idea that

1.  solves a real problem (**one you personally have**)
2.  is in a **market he knows well**
3.  should not be a new idea (not world changing)
4.  could become a viable business

## MVP

Mr Hakobyan shipped the MVP in two months.
It seems like a long time but he didn't "hustle" and instead worked only 1-2 hours every day and **slept at least 8 hours** (ideas echoed by DHH in [his talk at Startup School](https://youtu.be/0CDXJ6bMkMY)).
He also kept a strict routine instead of "cramming".

One good tips is to **keep the objectives small** to be able to finish at least one task a day.
Seeing progress also helps with motivation.

## Closed Beta Launch

After announcing the beta launch on Twitter, several people came forward to test the product.
This permits to have early on feedback.

## Public Launch

After incorporating some feedback and fixing bugs, the public launch was announced three months in.

## Lesson learned

Except for the points already mentioned above, Mr Hakobyan gives a last great advice:

**Talk about your project**.
Because you have to get the word out and market your project.
That's the only way oters will discover it in the beginning.
