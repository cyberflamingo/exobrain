# Internet Changed the Concept of Privacy

Before explaining how the concept of privacy has changed with Internet, I'll
first explain privacy in the _before time_.


## Before Generalized Internet

... privacy was pretty straightforward: if you were alone in your room, door
and curtains closed, you could expect reasonably that nobody was watching you.
What you did in your room would be considered _private_.

Consider putting someone in your bedroom with you. First you would be quite
astonished to find a complete stranger near your bed, then if that person were
to following you around and writting down everything you did and everything you
said, you'd have a hard time to consider your room private anymore. Most likely
you'd want to take this stranger notepad, scrap it, and kick the stranger out
of your house. But the very first side effect of not being private anymore is
you censoring—or filtering—yourself: your behavior change under scrutinity.


## On Modern Internet

Things are a lot more difficult. Actually in my opinion the comparison with the
_before_ time isn't even possible. We are not talking about one human stranger
in your room but a whole team of robots. In addition they can take down notes
at light-speed, cross-find information almost as fast and their notepad are
copied over and over all over the world (and thus impossible to delete).
Robots don't even have to sleep and you can't kick them[^1]!

Interestingly, while way more intrusive than our stranger in the bedroom, most
people still believe to be private with their electronic device. Even amongst
those who know about data collection, a (fortunatly decreasing) majority
decides to not accept the reality of their every stoke (or lack of!) being
scrutinized in real time.

This is actually a feature: lack of privacy makes you change your behavior (as
we saw above) and does not make you feel good (who likes the persistent idea
of being watch?). Therefore websites and apps go to great length to hide away
the constant data collection and what can only be described as surveillance.


## What it Means for Privacy

In this note I'm not going to write about the "I don't care about privacy
because I have nothing to hide" rabbit hole; this is a topic for another day
(?cf “I’ve Got Nothing to Hide” and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy).

What I want to focus instead is on how the idea of privacy changed.

The way we should think about privacy has come from "fragments of information
here and there that unrelated people knows about me" to a "holistic and
contextual, daily updated profile of you and your whole circles of friends
and family". It's a whole new (and hard to grasp) scale.

For an example of "fragments of information", let's imagine a random person
going to the store a few decades ago. The clerk may remember that person
favorite brand of chocolate and make sure it is in stock each time he or she
visits. There is a security camera at each exit. There may even be a client
fidelity program.

This system (still available in a lot of store) has data retention, don't get
me wrong, but:

* It has an expiration date (physical human memory of your favorite clerk) and
  data retention policy for the tapes of the security footages
* Almost no context; store does not know your surroundings or what else you buy
  where and with whom
* Shopping habits is limited to whatever your fidelity card retains, which
  isn't probably much outside the store


Compare this to the kind of tracking used nowadays (using Google as an example):

* You haven't even step a foot in the store but Google knows you've been
  checking recipe online and that you may be interested in buying ingredients
* You've looked up direction (or traffic) to the store. You've still not step a
  foot in the store but GPS gives away each and every stop you make and for how
  long to Google
* In some case, paying with credit card/cashless gives away content of your
  basket (your store account/fidelity program may also be linked to your Google
  account)
* It also knows every other store you've been and every other purchase you've
  made
* It knows your interest (regretting googling stuff yet?)
* It knows your friends and family
* It knows your email...

I can go on and on but the point is not to make an exhaustive list. The point
is the scale is a magnitude different than what we were used to and maybe we
should stop, or slow down a bit and think about it for a little bit. Because
[[eb96e4bb]]# and because it's not just about "me" or "you" anymore. It's about
"us".

You may not care (it's your right) but maybe a family member does, and right
now their right are being trumped because their surrounding are giving away
private data (consciously or not) without any way for the concerned family
member to opt out.

Data collection may have its advantage: a timely sale for a product you were
eyeing for some times, a context aware user experience tomake you more
productive[^2] etc.

Still, more and more people—like me—finds this ever watching robots eyes
insufferable and the trade off not worth it. We try to limit the data they can
access to what we consent to give (or for more private people, to a minimum).
My devices are like my bedroom: you may know what I am doing in it, it does
not mean I want you to take a look at it.
