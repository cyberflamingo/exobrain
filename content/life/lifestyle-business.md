# Lifestyle Business

This is an interesting concept I discovered some weeks ago: "lifestyle
business'.

Being on Twitter and to some extend in the _programming/startups_ culture of
the Bay Area, mosts dicussions centers around sucessful Angel-backed startups.

I was therefore shocked to learn about **lifestyle business**, a concept I
wasn't familiar with, although it represents _more than 90%_ of all
businesses[^1].

What's more, the business type I am more familiar with represents less than 1%
of all businesses. Talk about loud minority.

Some people make do by quietly pulling $10m/year in profit with a team of 25 in
a city you've never heard of, making actuarial software for funeral homes.

It's unfortunate, but not surprising, hat venture capitalists have been mocking
the term, using it as a pejorative catchall to dismiss any entrepreneur who
isn't thinking in terms of "growth" and "big exit"[^2].

One critic that seems to often comes up is "how can it be a _real_ business if
you are not putting the hours?" but as David Heinemeier Hansson puts it:

> It’s been a long time since there was a direct correlation with the number of
> hours you work and the success you enjoy. It’s an antiquated notion from the
> days of manual labour that has no bearing on the world today.
