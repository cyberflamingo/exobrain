Containers: a Primer
====================

At a high level, a container is a *slice of an operating system* running
on a server (or personal computer) which runs an app. By preference one
app per container.

Containers are generally smaller and more efficient than running a whole
OS running on a virtual machine on top of a hypervisor. This is why apps
in containers should start promptly.

Apps running in a containers are called *containerized apps*.

Famous container technologies include [[docker]]# and [[kubernetes]]#.
