# Convert Date to Current Time Zone

Sometimes I wish to participate to online event or just speak with people in a
different time zone.

While there are online converters, I found most of them terribly confusing.

Anyway, convertion can be done offline with just a terminal, so here it goes:

```sh
$ date -d '2014-06-26 23:00 UTC'
Fri 27 Jun 2014 08:00:00 AM JST
```
