# Video Calibration

Display calibration is optimization of display settings to establish a
standard.

In general we talk about calibring the following:
* Brightness
* Contrast
* Resolution
* Sharpness
* Color Temperatture
* RGB Cuts/Gains
* CMS
* Colorspace


## Why Calibrate?

In order to have a accurate representation of images.


## Calibration of Computer Monitor

Calibration is different for each display type. I am more concerned with
computer monitors.

However, to perform a calibration right, one need a specialized device. I don't
have one at time and don't intend to buy one in a near future.
