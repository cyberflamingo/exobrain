# On Tabbing/Bracing Style

Tabbing/bracing style has been the subject for much debate.

In a larger sense, I believe these conversations are uninteresting. 

I actually like the new wave of automated source code formatting; it reduces
the amount of time passed on debating tab/space pros and cons, and it makes for
a cleaner, easier to read, formatted code.

It also take away the burden of choosing what style following, something I
absolutely spend too much time on.

As a "fun things to discuss" conversation, it could be fun to engage to, though
I haven't really given much thought to it and I can't seems to find any hard
pros/cons for either camp anyway[^1].

[^1]: With the exception maybe for tabs which sometimes don't render well on a terminal over SSH, but I'm sure this too can be set somehow.
