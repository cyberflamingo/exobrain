# Pairwise (All-Pair) Testing

Pairwsie testing (or all-pair testing) is used to test every possible discrete
combinaison of values.

The goal is to reduce the number of test to its minimum will still behing
exhaustive, and this before the end of the world (or before your company runs
out of money).

Creating pairwise combination is possible by hand but it's also a field where
computer excels so better let them do that.

A great tool to create pairwise combination is [PICT](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict), or _Pairwise
Independent Combinatorial Testing_ by Microsoft.
