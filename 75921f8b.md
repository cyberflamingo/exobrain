# Configuring Matomo for Better Privacy

{.ui .warning .message}
I do not recommend the use of an audience/tracking system. Although they can be
usefull in some cases, they are mostly vanity tools for most webmasters.
Before installing one, one should ask himself/herself, should I use my visitors
as guinea pig?


While I don't use nor endorce it anymore, Matomo is amongst the few good
self-hosted audience checking tool that can be tweaked to respect users'
privacy.

I follow France's [CNIL own recommendation](https://www.cnil.fr/en/node/329)[^1] in order to be complient with the so called 'cookie law'.

In your Matomo script, insert the lines below between `var _paq = _paq || [];`
and `_paq.push(['trackPageView']);`:

```javascript
_paq.push([function() {
      var self = this;
      function getOriginalVisitorCookieTimeout() {
          var now = new Date(),
          nowTs = Math.round(now.getTime() / 1000),
          visitorInfo = self.getVisitorInfo();
          var createTs = parseInt(visitorInfo[2]);
          var cookieTimeout = 33696000; // 13 mois en secondes
          var originalTimeout = createTs + cookieTimeout - nowTs;
          return originalTimeout;
      }
      this.setVisitorCookieTimeout( getOriginalVisitorCookieTimeout() );
  }]);
```


There are also several settings we can adjust:

* Anonymize Visitors' IP addresses: **Yes**
* Select how many bytes of the visitors' IPs should be masked: **2 or 3 bytes**
* Also use the Anonymized IP addresses when enriching visits: **Yes**
* Support Do Not Track preference: **Enable**

Finish by setting up an opt-out iframe for your website visitors.


A more up to date recommendation from Matomo itself can be found [here](https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/).
