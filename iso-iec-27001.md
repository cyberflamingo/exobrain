standard.

What it Means
-------------

ISO/IEC 27001 (below, ISO 27001) is a **specification** which outlines
the exact requirements for what is deemed as best practice in
information security. It is related to **management system for
information security** and **risk management**. It has two parts:

-   Management processes to implement
-   List of technical controls

It is created by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
