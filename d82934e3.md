# Google AMP is a Hostile Attempts to Control the Web

There has been a lot of attempts to control the web over the years but one of
the more persuasive and hostile takeover has been Google AMP, the "solution" of
Google to the website obesity problem.

I need to add here that the intention (making a faster, less bloated web) are
honorable[^1], does it justify the degree of control that the parent company
exercises over the web as a result?

1. AMP pages are hosted on Google servers, removing control for the website
   owner and centralizing more and more the web
2. Mob-like tactics to force you to use AMP ("would be a shame if... you didn't
   appear on this carousel, hu?")
3. For some website, being AMP-compliant require _adding more stuff_ resulting
   in often worse load-times


## AMP is About Control (in my opinion)

It is about getting more user data. Sure, it "fixes" problems created by
publishers/some developers themselves. But fundamentally it is about getting
big websites traffic on Google servers.

It's sad people think it's "unreasonable" to de-bloat a website, but taking
time to implement APM is a "good idea".


[^1]: _Although_ one could argue a big reason the web is bloated is because of Google and its ads network
