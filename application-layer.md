# Application Layer

Application layer protocols are the protocols which applications most
directly interacts with.

Protocols on this layer rely on the protocols on layers below to ensure
messages get to their destination. What they focus on is the **structure of
that message** and the **data that it contain**.

Application layer protocols can be thought of as a set of rules to define
how applications talk to each other. Different type of application will
have different rules, which means there are a lot of protocol on this
layer. For example. the rules of communication for an email server is
different than the rules of communication for a web server.

From the most popular protocols we can cite SMTP, FTP or the
[[http-protocol]]#.
